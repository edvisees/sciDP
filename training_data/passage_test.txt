The MDC1 SDTD motif does not conform to consensus sequences targeted by ATM or other DDR kinases .	result
Instead , both the serine and threonine residues in the SDTD sequence match the CK2 consensus motif of phosphorylated serine/threonine followed by an acidic residue at the +3 position (	result
p [ S/T ] xxD/E	result
Consistent with this , a bacterially expressed protein ( glutathione S-transferase ( GST ) -SDTD2 ) encompassing two MDC1 SDTD motifs ( contained within amino-acid residues 296-340 of MDC1 ) was efficiently	result
phosphorylated by recombinant CK2 in vitro , as shown by a marked decrease in electrophoretic mobility and detection by anti-MDC1 pS329/pT331 antiserum ( Fig 2C , upper and lower panels , respectively )	result
By contrast , the equivalent protein bearing alanine substitutions of Thr 301 and	result
Thr 331 ( GST-SDAD2 ) , while being phosphorylated by CK2 to some degree ( presumably on CK2 consensus serine residues retained in the SDAD motifs present in this fusion protein ) , was detected only weakly with the anti-MDC1 pS329/pT331 antiserum ( Fig 2C )	result
Moreover ,	result
although CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the GST-SDTD2 protein allowed it to retrieve MRN from HeLa nuclear extracts	result

ErbB family members show high homology in the kinase domain ( 59-81 % identity ) ,	fact
whereas the C-terminal domains are more divergent ( 11-25 % identity )	fact
ErbB3 was the receptor showing the weakest homology to the other three receptors .	result
Nevertheless , characteristic sequences around two tyrosine residues are identical in all four receptors : tyrosines Y900 of EGFR , Y908 of ErbB2 , Y897 of ErbB3 and Y906 of ErbB4 , all are embedded in the sequence SDVWSYGVTVW ; and	result
tyrosine Y944 of EGFR , Y952 of ErbB2 , Y941 of ErbB3 and Y950 of ErbB4 , all have the identical sequence CTIDVYMIMVK ( underlined and color coded in Figure 1 )	result
Tyrosine 944 of the EGF-receptor is phosphorylated by Src-kinase ( Stover et al , 1995 ) .	result
To both of these shared tyrosine-containing sequences no interaction partners were found ,	result
suggesting that these sequences are conserved for structural functions or that they mediate other types of effects	implication
Furthermore , two pairs of phosphotyrosine-containing sequences are identical in EGFR and ErbB2 .	fact
One of these pairs ( pY764 in EGFR and pY772 in ErbB2 ) has no interaction partner and the other ( pY10l6 in EGFR and pY1023 in ErbB2 ) mediates interaction with PTP-2c .	fact
In addition , the protein sequence around pY978 in EGFR and pY984 in ErbB4 is identical , and in our experiments , binds STAT5 and PTP-2c	result

We have previously demonstrated	result
The dispensable role of IKKalpha in NF-kappaB activation through TNFR-I was also confirmed by the detection of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha in IKKalpha-deficient EFs after TNF stimulation ( Fig . 2 C ) .	result
Because NIK is essential for LTbetaR signaling , as demonstrated above , and NIK has been shown to phosphorylate IKKalpha 26	result
, it is important to determine whether IKKalpha is also essential for LTbetaR signaling .	hypothesis
We therefore treated EFs from IKKalpha-deficient mice with agonistic anti-LTbetaR mAb and assessed NF-kappaB activation by the detection of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha .	method
We found	result
that IKKalpha-deficient EFs showed no IkappaBalpha phosphorylation after LTbetaR stimulation , suggesting that NIK-IKKalpha constitutes an important pathway in LTbetaR signaling ( Fig . 2 B )	result
LTbetaR expression assessed by flow-cytometric analysis with anti-LTbetaR mAb ( AF.H6 ) was similar among wild-type , aly , and IKKalpha-deficient EFs ( Fig . 2 D ) .	result
The basal level of NF-kappaB activation , assessed by the treatment of EFs with ALLN alone ,	result
which blocks the degradation of phosphorylated IkappaBalpha by proteasomes 3	fact

In addition to direct binding of Grb2 to phosphotyrosine residues of receptor kinases , Grb2 can also be recruited to the receptor by binding	fact
to Shc when Shc is tyrosine phosphorylated as a result of receptor stimulation	fact
Phosphorylation of Shc results in binding of Grb2 to the phosphorylated tyrosine of Shc via its SH2 domain .	fact
We found	result
that five bait phosphopeptides had Grb2 and Shc as common binding partners	result
However , in all five cases , the bait peptide contained overlapping binding motifs for Grb2 and Shc (	result
see also inset in Figure 3	result
Furthermore , the experiments were carried out in cells	method
that were not especially stimulated with growth factor ( even though they were grown in the presence of serum )	method
Thus ,	implication
most signal-dependent multi-protein complexes are not present	implication
Therefore , the identification of Grb2 in our pull-down experiments is most likely due	implication
to direct binding and not indirect binding as an interaction partner of Shc	implication
For the above reasons , we believe	implication
that our experiments generally yield the direct or primary phosphotyrosine interactome rather than protein complexes	implication

Like LPS , the TLR3 ligand poly ( I : C ) also induces lethality in mice through a TNF-dependent mechanism27 .	result
We thus examined the effect of Peli1 deficiency on the lethality induced by poly ( I : C ) .	method
Compared to LPS , poly ( I : C ) was relatively inefficient in	result
inducing lethality	result
Nevertheless , at a high dose ( 0.5 mug/g body weight ) , poly ( I : C ) induced death of most of the Peli1+/+ mice within 8 hours but none of the Peli1-/- mice at this early time point ( Fig . 1b ) .	result
Even at late times , only 1 out of 6 Peli1-/- mice died .	result

To assess whether PAG is identical to the GEM- and Fyn-associated pp80 and to the major leukocyte tyrosine-phosphorylated 80-kD polypeptide	goal
, GEMs were immunoprecipitated from Raji cells using CD59 mAb and subjected to in vitro kinase assay followed by reprecipitation using anti-PAG mAbs .	method
As demonstrated in Fig . 3 A	result
, pp80 was selectively reprecipitated from the mixture of in vitro-phosphorylated GEM proteins .	result
Similarly , a polyclonal mouse anti-PAG Ab reprecipitated pp80-85 from an in vitro-labeled Fyn immunoprecipitate prepared from resting human T lymphocytes ( Fig . 3 B ) .	result
Finally , anti-PAG immunosorbent specifically removed the tyrosine-phosphorylated 75-80-kD protein from lysates of peripheral blood T cells ( Fig . 3 C ) .	result
Thus , PAG is identical to GEM/Fyn-associated pp80-85 and to the leukocyte tyrosine-phosphorylated pp80 .	implication

The above data strongly suggest	implication
that NIK and IKKalpha together control LTbetaR signaling with a close mechanistic relationship in their pathway	implication
We have therefore reasoned	hypothesis
that impaired LTbetaR signaling in aly mice may be due to defective interaction between mutated NIK and IKKalpha	hypothesis
To investigate this , NIK and IKKalpha were coexpressed in COS-7 cells	goal
, and protein interactions were assessed by immunoprecipitation .	method
Association of wild-type NIK with IKKalpha was easily detected ( Fig . 4 ) .	result
In contrast , association of aly type NIK , which corresponds to a G855R substitution in mice , with IKKalpha was disrupted by the mutation ,	result
providing further support for the role of NIK-IKKalpha as an essential pathway for NF-kappaB activation in LTbetaR signaling	implication
Despite this finding , the possibility remains	hypothesis
that aly mice might have a different phenotype from NIK-null mutation mice	hypothesis

TOR signaling has been well established in the regulation of cell and organ size in Drosophila35 , 36 .	fact
This led	method
us to examine the contribution of dRagA and dRagC to cell growth in vivo	method
dRagA wild type , constitutively active mutant dRagA Q61L , and dominant negative mutant dRagA T16N were each expressed in posterior wing compartments	method
using the posterior driver en-GAL4	method
We found	result
that expression of the constitutively active dRagA Q61L but not the wild type dRagA significantly increased posterior compartment size relative to that of the control anterior compartment ( Fig . 4a )	result
In contrast , expression of the dominant negative dRagA T16N decreased posterior wing compartment size .	result
Consistent with these results , expression of dRagA Q61L increased individual cell size of the wing ,	result
while expression of dRagA T16N reduced cell size ( Fig . 4b )	result
We also expressed dRagA in the dorsal wing surface of the wing	result
using the dorsal specific ap-GAL4	result
As predicted	result
, expression of dRagA Q61L or dRagA T16N caused wing curvature downward or upward , respectively ( Fig .	result
S4a , b ) .	result
These results support	implication
that high activity of dRagA promotes cell growth and low activity of dRagA inhibits cell growth	implication

We previously reported	result
that mitogenic stimulation of resting CCL39 cells led to a rapid nuclear translocation of MAPKs into the nucleus ( 27 ) .	result
Translocation into the nucleus correlated nicely with the persistent activation of MAPK during the G1 phase of the cell cycle .	result
For example , serum or alpha-thrombin , two potent mitogens of CCL39 cells , induced persistent MAPK activation and nuclear localization .	result
In contrast , the thrombin receptor peptide activator or TPA , which transiently activates MAPK , failed	result
to induce nuclear translocation of MAPK ( 27 ) .	result
This result led	hypothesis
us to postulate that the p42/p44 MAPK cascade itself controls the nuclear translocation of MAPK .	hypothesis
Therefore , we tested	goal
whether addition of the specific MEK inhibitor PD 98059 ( 12 ) was sufficient to block the entry of p42/p44 MAPK in the nucleus in response to serum .	goal
This inhibitor has been previously shown	result
to inhibit by up to 90 % MAPK activation without affecting the activation of other MAPK cascades , such as the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways ( 2 ) .	result
In accordance to our and others ' previous observations , p42/p44 MAPK immunostaining is predominantly cytoplasmic in serum-deprived cells ( Fig . 1 A ) and in cells treated by the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 alone ( Fig . 1 D ) ,	result
whereas within 3 h of stimulation by 10 % FCS , it is relocated markedly in the nucleus ( Fig . 1 B ) .	result
As depicted in Fig . 1 C , the addition of the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 ( 30 muM ) at the time of serum addition was sufficient	result
to block nuclear translocation of p42/p44 MAPK .	result
As	result
was reported by Alessi et al .	result
( 2 ) we found	result
that MAPK activity was not totally inhibited by 30 muM of PD 98059 compound in CCL39 cells ( up to 80 % inhibition ) .	result
This incomplete inhibition could explain	implication
why in certain cells some nuclear localization of p42/p44 MAPK remained .	implication
In these cells it is possible	hypothesis
that MAPK stimulation by serum may be extremely potent .	hypothesis
However , this result indicates	implication
that activation of the p42/p44 MAPK signaling cascade in response to serum is absolutely required for nuclear translocation of p42/p44 MAPK .	implication

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed	method
to ascertain the expression of Ror2 in 293 and L cells	goal
A specific Ror2 transcript in the L cell sample did not emerge until after 40 cycles of amplification ,	result
indicating that Ror2 is expressed in almost immeasurably low abundance in L cells	implication
Quantification of the real-time data revealed	method
that Ror2 transcripts were over 700 times more abundant in 293 cells than in L cells ( Figure 6C )	result
mRor2 expression thus appears	implication
to be required for Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mouse L cells	implication

TRF2 was overexpressed in IMR90 primary fibroblasts using a retroviral vector .	method
Under these conditions , TRF2 saturates its telomeric binding sites and is present in the nucleoplasm .	result
While control IMR90 cells showed the expected reduction in mitotic index after ionizing radiation ( IR )	result
, TRF2 overexpression partially abrogated this checkpoint response , increasing the percentage of cells entering mitosis from 0.3 % to 8 % ( Figure 1 ) .	result
The inappropriate entry into mitosis is indicative of a failure of the cell cycle checkpoints .	implication
Since cell cycle arrest after IR largely depends on ATM ( reviewed in Shiloh 2003 )	fact
, we asked whether TRF2 was acting on this kinase .	hypothesis
Caffeine , an inhibitor of ATM and the related kinase ATR , suppressed IR-induced arrest to a similar extent as TRF2 ( Figure 1 ) .	result
Furthermore , caffeine had	result
no additional effect on the ability of TRF2-overexpressing cells to bypass the DSB checkpoint , suggesting that TRF2 and caffeine target	none
the same step in the response pathway .	implication

Based on these results , primary PAG immunoprecipitates obtained from lysates of unstimulated or pervanadate-treated hematopoietic cells were analyzed for the presence of the above cytoplasmic	method
signaling molecules .	method
Small amounts of Fyn ( but not Lck ; not shown ) were found in PAG immunoprecipitates prepared from unstimulated peripheral blood T cells ( Fig . 7 B ) but not Jurkat or Raji cells ( not shown ) .	result
Moreover , Fyn and PAG also associated with each other	result
when coexpressed in COS cells ( Fig . 7 E ) .	result
However , the interaction between Fyn and PAG seems	result
to be independent from the tyrosine phosphorylation status of PAG , as it was not altered after PP1 treatment of the resting T cells ( which caused a strong decrease of PAG tyrosine phosphorylation ; Fig . 7B ) .	result

Because p130CAS is known to translocate to focal adhesions when phosphorylated by the integrin pathway ( Harte et al. , 1996 ) , and since PTP-PEST and p130CAS associate via an SH3 proline-rich domain interaction ( Garton et al. , 1997 )	fact
, we first verified if PTP-PEST could translocate within a cell following integrin stimulation .	hypothesis
COS-1 cells were transfected with a PTP-PEST construct tagged with the hemagglutinin antigen ( HA ) epitope ,	method
allowing visualization by indirect immunofluorescence ( Fig . 1 )	method
Untransfected cells showed no immunofluorescence staining ( Fig . 1 b ) ,	result
demonstrating the absence of nonspecific staining with the 12CA5 antibody	implication
In transfected cells ( Fig . 1 d ) , PTP-PEST localization was diffuse in the cytoplasm ,	result
as previously described ( Charest et al. , 1995 )	result
When the cells were stimulated with 0.1 mug/ml of EGF , no significant change in PTP-PEST staining was observed ( Fig . 1 f ) ,	result
although PTP-PEST was shown previously to associate with the EGF receptor via Grb2 ( Charest et al. , 1997 )	result
However , for a significant percentage of attached transfected cells plated on fibronectin-coated slides for 45 min , staining for the HA epitope showed a clear relocalization to the membrane periphery even with lower levels of protein expression ( Fig . 1 g ) .	result
These results prove	implication
that , in COS-1 cells , PTP-PEST can relocalize to the membrane periphery following integrin , but not EGF receptor , stimulation	implication

To explore the intracellular localization of the Rac1-beta-Pix compl	goal
complex, we transfected HEK293 cells with HA-tagged Rac1 and seeded these cells on fibronectin for 1 h.	method
Immunostainings for endogenous beta-Pix and HA-tagged Rac1	method
showed that in the basal section of the cell, Rac1 and beta-Pix colocalize to FAs (Manser et al., 1998; Turner et al., 1999) particularly at the periphery of the cell (Fig. 2 F, basal and zoom).	result
In the middle section of the cell, the two proteins colocalize markedly at the periphery but not in the center and colocalize most prominently in membrane ruffles (Fig. 2 F, middle).	result

To determine whether the isolation membranes are derived from the newly generated , Apg5-associated small compartment	goal
, we carried out time-lapse video microscopy .	method
Small dots of GFP-Apg5 appeared and elongated slowly , and then bent and became semi-spherical structures ( Fig . 7 A and videos 1-3 ) .	result
Finally , the GFP signal disappeared	result
when the structure was close to forming a complete spherical body .	result
Such a pattern of development is consistent with the electron microscopic images ( Fig . 6 , E-J ) .	result
The time-lapse microscopy showed	method
that the GFP-Apg5 spots were transient , appearing at random times during amino acid starvation and disappearing immediately before or after circularization , never forming any stable structures ( Fig . 7 B ) .	result

Another focal adhesion component	none
to be investigated	none
The role of p130CAS in migration was shown	result
to reside in the pathways triggered by FAK ( Cary et al. , 1998 ) , which is associated with the integrins and becomes active by transphosphorylation	result
Phosphorylation of Y397 on FAK , which is the binding site of the Src kinase , was shown	result
to be crucial for its role in cell migration ( Cary et al. , 1998 )	result
Fig . 4 a shows	result
that FAK is slightly hyperphosphorylated in the PTP-PEST null cells , suggesting that this PTP may regulate its phosphorylation level	none
Since FAK and PTP-PEST were never shown to interact directly , it is possible	hypothesis
that this hyperphosphorylation is a consequence of p130CAS or paxillin hyperphosphorylation	hypothesis

To investigate whether CK2 phosphorylation of the MDC1 SDTD region promotes MRN binding in vivo , we transiently expressed	goal
a haemagglutinin ( HA ) -tagged MDC1 SDTD fragment coupled to a nuclear localization sequence in U20S cells ( HA-SDTD6 ; supplementary Fig S1C online )	method
Immunoblotting showed	result
that treating these cells with the CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-benzimidazole increased the electrophoretic mobility of the MDC1 SDTD fragment and reduced the ability of the fragment to co-immunoprecipitate MRN ( Fig 2E )	result

Autophagy is thought	hypothesis
to be a major pathway for degradation of cytoplasmic proteins .	hypothesis
We assessed bulk degradation of long-lived proteins by	goal
measuring the release of TCA-soluble [ 14C ] valine from cells .	method
Lysosomal protein degradation was estimated by the difference between the [ 14C ] valine release from cells treated with and without lysosomotropic reagents such as chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 , a vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor .	method
Lysosomal protein degradation induced by amino acid starvation in APG5-/- cells was significantly reduced to less than half of that in APG5+/+ and APG5+/- cells ( Fig . 3A and Fig .	result
Apg5 cDNA transformants ( WT1 , WT13 , and GFP24 ) restored protein degradation ,	result
confirming the specificity of Apg5 deficiency ( Fig . 3 B ) .	result
Cells grown in nutrient-rich medium showed a very low level of basal lysosomal degradation , with no significant difference between APG5+/+ and APG5-/- cells .	result
These data indicate	implication
that autophagy is indeed a major route for lysosomal protein degradation .	implication
In addition , in the KR27 clone , protein degradation was not restored ,	result
suggesting that Apg12 conjugation of Apg5 is essential for autophagic degradation .	implication

In addition to typical isolation membranes , there were some smaller structures	result
that were labeled throughout with gold particles ( Fig . 6B and Fig .	result
C , double arrows , and E and F ) .	result
These single membrane-bound compartments adopted a crescent shape and were induced by amino acid starvation .	result
Occasionally , small vesicles were observed inside these compartments .	result
The curved morphology suggests	implication
that these structures represent the early stage of the development of isolation membrane .	implication

6 , B and C , show the localization of p42/p44	result
MAPK after 3 and 5 h of serum stimulation , respectively .	result
In both cases , MAPKs are clearly accumulated in the nucleus with perhaps a less intense signal at 5 h ( Fig . 6 C ) because of a decline in p42/p44 MAPK activity .	result
However , the inhibition of protein synthesis with CHX for the last 2 h of serum stimulation markedly accelerated the cytoplasmic return of p42/p44 MAPK ( Fig . 6 , compare C and E ) .	result
This acceleration of MAPK nuclear efflux was already apparent 1 h after CHX addition ( Fig . 6 D ) .	result

To investigate whether the SDTD motifs might interact with other DDR components , we generated a synthetic peptide	goal
that corresponded to MDC1 residues 325-340 bearing dual phosphorylation on Ser 329 and Thr 331	method
This peptide and its unphosphorylated equivalent were coupled to beads and used	method
to retrieve interacting proteins from HeLa cell nuclear extracts	method
This approach identified four prominent protein bands on a silver-stained gel	result
that bound in a phosphorylation-dependent manner ( Fig 1B )	result
Mass spectrometric analysis identified three of these as MRE11 , RAD50 and NBS1 .	result
We noted	result
that control binding assays with the gammaH2AX phospho-peptide retrieved MRN and MDC1 from nuclear extracts , whereas the phosphorylated SDTD peptide bound MRN only ( Fig 1C )	result
This indicates	implication
that the phosphorylated MDC1 SDTD peptide does not interact with MRN indirectly by bridging contacts with MDC1	implication

Experimental	none
requirements to study spatial redistribution of DSB regulators	none

The two migration assays are complementary ,	method
since each has different limitations	method
For instance , the wound healing assay is affected by the rates of cell proliferation and by cell-cell adhesive interactions	method
which restrict the ability of the cells to move into the wounded area	method
In the chamber assay , differences in cell shape and size may alter the ability of the cells	method
to pass through the pores	method
Taken together , the data suggest	implication
that the loss of PTP-PEST results in motility defects in embryonic fibroblast cell lines that can be reincreased by overexpression of PTP-PEST in the ( -/- ) cells	implication

We purified the Wnt5a protein from cells overexpressing the mouse Wnt5a gene using methods derived from those developed for other members of the Wnt family with	method
several modifications ( Figure1A ) [ 27 ]	method
Throughout the purification , we followed the Wnt5a protein	method
using an antibody that detects Wnt5a on a Western blot	method
Later steps in the purification were also monitored by activity assays (	method
see below	method
To unambiguously identify the purified protein as the product of the Wnt5a gene	goal
, we determined the amino-terminal sequence .	method
We found	result
that the mature protein starts with a sequence IIGAQPLCSQLAGLSQGQKKL , a sequence beginning 62 amino acids downstream from the predicted initiator methionine of Wnt5a and 24 amino acids from the predicted signal cleavage site between amino acids 37 and 38 [ 28 ]	result
While all Wnt proteins contain signal sequences required for secretion from cells	fact
, generally they are not internally cleaved at a site downstream from the signal sequence .	fact
The exception , interestingly , is the Drosophila ortholog of Wnt5a ;	fact
DWnt5 protein is made as a precursor of more than 1,000 amino acids weighing 140 kDa and cleaved into a smaller mature protein of 80 kDa [ 29 ]	fact
It is not known	fact
whether the processing of the Wnt5a molecule involves specific proteases	fact

To determine whether Wnt5a protein inhibits beta-catenin signaling via the direct activation of intracellular Ca 2+ flux downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins	goal
, 293 cells transiently transfected with the STF reporter were treated with 50 ng/ml W3a protein and increasing doses of Wnt5a protein following 24-h pretreatment with vehicle or 100 ng/ml ( 0.1 muM ) PTX .	method
Figure 3A shows	result
that Wnt5a protein-mediated inhibition of the STF reporter was not affected by PTX treatment	result
The PTX used was active in these cells , as lysophosphatidic acid ( LPA )	result
treatment of cells following pretreatment with PTX was unable to stimulate the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein	result
These data are consistent with Topol et al .	result
s [ 16 ] findings	result
that overexpression of a dominant negative version of CamKII , and treatment of cells with a specific inhibitor of CamKII , does not perturb Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in 293 cells	result

As an additional approach , murine BMMs obtained from SHIP +/+ and SHIP -/- mice were transiently transfected with the NFkappaB-luciferase construct .	method
Transfection of BMMs using the amaxa Nucleofector ( Solution T , program T-20 ; amaxa biosystems , Cologne , Germany ) yielded comparable transfection efficiency for both SHIP+/+ and SHIP-/- cells ,	result
as determined with plasmid encoding EGFP ( enhanced green fluorescent protein ; unpublished data ) .	result
Transfected BMMs were subsequently infected with F. novicida and assayed for luciferase activity .	method
BMMs lacking SHIP displayed significantly higher levels ( p < 0.05 ) of luciferase activity than the SHIP+/+ BMMs ,	result
indicating that SHIP negatively regulates F. novicida-induced activation of NFkappaB ( Figure 7C ) .	implication

We have previously shown that E3b1 binds to the proline-rich, COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 (aa 1131-1333) (Scita et al., 1999),	result
which also binds to the SH3 of Grb2 (Li et al., 1993; Cussac et al., 1994)	result
Thus, Grb2 and E3b1 might compete for binding to Sos-1.	hypothesis
This hypothesis was validated by a series of experiments performed both in vitro and in vivo.	implication
We could demonstrate that (a) the SH3 of Grb2, but not of Eps8, efficiently competed with the SH3 of E3b1 for binding to the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 in vitro (Fig. 2 B); (b) the Sos-1 peptide VPVPPPVPPRRR, known to constitute a Grb2-SH3 binding site (Li et al.,	result
1993; Cussac et al., 1994), competed equally well the binding of the COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 to the SH3s of Grb2 or E3b1 (Fig. 2 C); (c) the binding constants of the interaction between the proline rich COOH-terminal tail of Sos-1 and the SH3 domains of Grb2 and E3b1 were very similar (Fig. 2 D); (d) overexpression of Grb2 abolished the ability of GST-E3b1 to bind to native Sos-1 (Fig. 3 A); and (e) overexpression of E3b1 significantly decreased the coimmunoprecipitation between Grb2 and Sos-1 (Fig. 3 B).	result
Thus, Sos-1 binds either E3b1 or Grb2, in a mutually exclusive fashion,	implication
suggesting that two distinct pools of Sos-1 exist in the cells.	hypothesis

To determine which PTKs may phosphorylate PAG in vivo	goal
, COS cells were cotransfected with cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged PAG and various PTKs .	method
As shown in Fig . 4 B	result
, PAG serves as a substrate for Lck and Fyn but not for ZAP70 and/or Syk .	result
In Jurkat T cells , tyrosine phosphorylation of PAG was absent in the Lck-negative Jurkat mutant J.CaM1.6 but was normal or even enhanced in the ZAP70/Syk-negative mutant P116 ( Fig . 4 C ) ,	result
indicating that Lck might be primarily responsible for PAG phosphorylation in T cells .	implication
However ,	result
when wild-type Jurkat T cells ( or Raji cells , not shown ) were briefly treated with the Src family PTK-specific inhibitor PP1	result
, the constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PAG was lost ( Fig . 4 D ) .	result
This strongly suggests	implication
that the phosphorylation status of PAG is controlled by balanced activities of Src kinases ( likely Lck ) and an as yet unidentified tyrosine phosphatase ( s ) .	implication

One possible explanation for the observed abrogation of reporter activation is	hypothesis
that Wnt5a protein competes with Wnt3a for Fz receptor binding sites	hypothesis
Alternatively , Wnt5a has been proposed	hypothesis
to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling via upregulation of Siah-2 , which targets beta-catenin for betaTrCP-independent proteasomal degradation [ 16 ]	hypothesis
In both of these models , beta-catenin protein levels should be reduced following concomitant Wnt5a treatment compared to Wnt3a protein treatment alone ;	hypothesis
in the former case , signal transduction is blocked at the level of the receptor , whereas in the latter , any beta-catenin protein stabilized due to Wnt3a signal activation should be appreciably degraded by the opposing effects of Wnt5a	hypothesis

The inositol phosphatase SHIP plays an important role in	fact
regulating macrophage innate immune responses to IgG immune complexes and bacterial products [ 16,24-29 ] .	fact
Recent studies have indicated	result
that while SHIP negatively regulates TLR2 function [ 30 ] , it promotes TLR4 function [ 16,27,29 ] .	result
SHIP is a constitutively active , cytoplasmic enzyme	fact
that must translocate to the membrane where it accesses its substrate PI3,4,5P3 .	fact
Membrane translocation of SHIP is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP by membrane-associated Src kinases .	fact
Thus , tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP is often used as an indicator of SHIP translocation to the membrane [ 16 ] .	fact
To address the role of SHIP in F.	goal
novicida-stimulated host cell response , RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells were infected with F. novicida .	method
SHIP proteins were immunoprecipitated from uninfected and infected cells , and analyzed by Western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibody ( Figure 1A , upper panel ) .	method
The same membrane was reprobed with SHIP antibody (	method
lower panel	method
) .	method
Results indicate	result
that SHIP is tyrosine phosphorylated in cells infected with F. novicida , and that robust phosphorylation of SHIP occurs at the later time points ( 30 and 60 min post infection ) .	result
Having determined the time course of SHIP phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 cells	method
, we next tested whether these findings could be validated in primary cells .	method
Here murine bone marrow-derived macrophages ( BMMs ) were infected with F. novicida for varying times , and	method
phosphorylation of SHIP was analyzed by Western blotting with a phospho-specific SHIP antibody ( Figure 1B , upper panel ) .	method
Results indicated	result
that infection of BMMs by F. novicida induces tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP ( Figure 1B ) .	result
To ensure equal loading of protein in all lanes	goal
, the same membrane was reprobed with anti-SHIP antibody .	method
These results suggest a potential involvement of SHIP in F. novicida-induced macrophage signaling .	implication

Sos1 functions as a ras-specific GEF when bound to grb2 and as a rac1-specific GEF when it is part of the sos1-eps8-e3b1 complex.	fact
We therefore examined the role of p66shc in regulating the formation of these sos1-containing complexes.	goal
The amount of sos1 associated with eps8 was significantly greater in p66shc +/+ than in -/- MEF (Fig. 2 A).	result
Conversely, the amount of sos1 bound to grb2 was appreciably less in p66shc +/+ MEF than in -/- cells (Fig. 2 B).	result
A similar inverse relationship between p66shc expression and grb2-sos1 binding was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (Fig. 2 C).	result
Reconstitution of p66shcWT in p66shc -/- MEF increased sos1 associated with eps8 (Fig. 2 A) while decreasing sos1 bound to grb2 (Fig. 2 B).	result
In contrast, p66shcCH2 and -P47A/P50A led to little or no change in the amounts of grb2 and eps8 bound sos1 (Figs. 2, A and B).	result
Thus, full-length p66shc, via prolines 47 and 50, promotes dissociation of sos1 from grb2 in vivo and increases the formation of the sos1-eps8-e3b1 complex.	implication

We next assayed	goal
whether mRor2 was carrying out its inhibitory function through direct binding to Wnt5a	goal
Two variants of the extracellular cysteine-rich Wnt binding domain ( CRD ) of mRor2 were cloned in frame amino-terminal to an immunoglobulin heavy chain domain ( IgG )	method
One variant is comprised of the Ror2 CRD alone cloned downstream of an exogenous signal sequence ( Ror2 CRD-IgG ) ;	method
the other variant utilizes the endogenous Ror2 signal sequence and possesses the full amino terminus of the Ror2 protein ending at the carboxyl terminus of the CRD ( Ror2 NT CRD-IgG )	method
The secreted mRor2 CRD-IgG fusion proteins were then purified from conditioned media , bound	method
to protein A beads	method
The Smoothened receptor is a Fz family member that possesses a CRD domain but ,	fact
rather than playing a role in Wnt signaling , it functions exclusively Hedgehog signal transmission	fact
As a negative control , purified Smoothened ( Smo ) CRD-IgG protein was also bound to beads and assayed for Wnt binding .	method
that Wnt5a protein specifically binds to the purified Ror2 and Fz4 CRD domains , whereas only background binding to the Smoothened CRD occurs	result
Wnt3a protein shows specific binding only to the Fz4 CRD-IgG protein ( unpublished data ) .	result

A central signaling event involved in TLR-mediated gene induction is activation of IKK and its downstream transcription factor NF-kappaB 2 .	fact
To investigate the function of Peli1 in this process , we examined the effect of Peli1 deficiency on	goal
TLR-stimulated activation of IKK and NF-kappaB using different cell types	method
Consistent with the gene induction studies ( Fig . 2,3 ) , poly ( I : C ) -stimulated NF-kappaB activation was severely attenuated in Peli1-/- MEFs ( Fig . 4a ) .	result
The Peli1 deficient MEFs also showed a partial inhibition of NF-kappaB activation by LPS ( Fig . 4a ) .	result
Parallel kinase assays revealed that Peli1 deficiency largely impaired poly ( I : C ) -stimulated activation of IKK and also partially inhibited the LPS-stimulated activation of IKK ( Fig . 4b ) .	result
Since TLR4 activates IKK through both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent pathways , whereas TLR3 activates IKK exclusively through TRIF 2	fact
, these results suggest that Peli1 plays a non-redundant role in promoting IKK activation in the TRIF-dependent TLR pathway .	result

A role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in macrophage response to F. novicida infection has thus far not been described .	problem
The above observations of enhanced cytokine production and enhanced activation of Akt in SHIP-/- BMMs suggest a potential role for the PI3K/Akt pathway in F. novicida-induced inflammatory response .	hypothesis
To test this notion , we next treated	goal
F. novicida infected cells with the pharmacologic inhibitor of PI3K LY294002 , and monitored the release of IL-12 , IL-6 , and RANTES by ELISA .	method
The results are displayed in Figure 5 .	result
Inhibition of the PI3K pathway significantly decreased the production of IL-12 ( p < 0.009 ) , IL-6 ( p < 0.003 ) , and RANTES ( p < 0.03 ) by F. novicida-infected BMMs ,	result
indicating that the PI3K pathway is involved in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to F. novicida infection .	implication

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed	method
to ascertain the expression of Ror2 in 293 and L cells	goal
A specific Ror2 transcript in the L cell sample did not emerge until after 40 cycles of amplification ,	result
indicating that Ror2 is expressed in almost immeasurably low abundance in L cells	implication
Quantification of the real-time data revealed	result
that Ror2 transcripts were over 700 times more abundant in 293 cells than in L cells ( Figure 6C )	result
mRor2 expression thus appears	implication
to be required for Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mouse L cells	implication

We next utilized	method
When transiently transfected into 293 cells in conjunction with the STF reporter	result
, mRor2DeltaCRD does not enhance Wnt5a-mediated inhibition of the STF reporter ( Figure 5C ) .	result
Thus , the CRD domain binds directly to Wnt5a and is required for Ror2	implication
to transduce Wnt5a 's inhibitory activity	implication

Although stimulation of VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells is known to promote activation of Src kinases [15]	fact
and Src activation is linked to endothelial cell permeability, survival and angiogenesis [16], [17	implication
[16], [17], the nature of its association with VEGFR-2, in particular, the putative phospho-tyrosine residue on VEGFR-2 involved in its recruitment is not.	problem
Our survey of several primary endothelial cells including, HUVEC, HMVE and BAEC cells	method
showed that c-Src is ubiquitously tyrosine phosphorylated in response to VEGF stimulation (Figure 1A) and associates with VEGFR-2 in a ligand-dependent manner in these primary endothelial cells (Figure 1C).	implication
Cell lysates obtained from HEK-293 (human embryonic kidney-293) cells	method
which do not express VEGFR-2	fact
was negative for VEGFR-2	result
and was used as a negative control (Figure 1C).	method
The cytoplasmic region of VEGFR-2 contains multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites [18], albeit none of these tyrosine autophosphorylation sites shows obvious sequence similarities to the preferred Src SH2 recognition motif, pYEEI [19].	fact
To analyze association of c-Src with VEGFR-2	goal
we utilized the previously characterized VEGFR-2 chimera [20]	method
herein called CKR	fact
which is created by replacing the extracellular domain of VEGFR-2 with that of human Colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) and expressed in PAE (porcine aortic endothelial) cells as an experimental system.	method
In our previous studies we have extensively characterized CKR with VEGFR-2 in a comparative manner.	method
CKR in term of its ability undergo down-regulation, activation, recruitment of signaling proteins and to stimulate cellular responses is identical to VEGFR-2 [3], [14], [20], [21] and data presented in this manuscript.	fact
We used this strategy to avoid cross-talk between VEGFR-2 and other VEGF receptors, in particular, VEGFR-1.	method
Our initial observation demonstrated that mutation of tyrosines 799, 820, 925 to phenylalanine (F) and deletion of C-terminus of VEGFR-2 coupled with mutation of tyrosines 1173 and 1212 has no effect on the ability of VEGFR-2 to associate with the SH2 domain of c-Src (Figure 1E).	result
In contrast, mutation of Y1052 to glutamic acid (E) and particularly Y1057, located in the kinase domain, severely reduced the binding of VEGFR-2 with SH2 domain of c-Src (Figure 1G).	result
GST alone does not associate with CKR (Figure S3).	fact
Consistent with its reduced binding capability to E1052,	fact
the result showed that E1052 only partially reduces the ability of VEGFR-2 to phosphorylate c-Src (Figure 1I).	implication
In contrast, the potential of mutant Y1057 (E1057/CKR) to stimulate Src tyrosine phosphorylation was severely compromised and was near to undetectable (Figure 1I).	result
Since both	fact
Y1052 and Y1057 are located in the kinase domain	fact
we replaced these residues to glutamic acid (E) rather than phenylalanine (F).	method
This type of mutations has been suggested to be useful for characterization of sensitive tyrosine sites on the RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases) when their mutation to phenylalanine interferes with receptor activation [15].	hypothesis
However, unlike these RTKs, single mutation of Y1052 and Y1057 either to E or F did not interfere with activation of VEGFR-2 in the context of CKR (Figures S1 and S2).	result
Furthermore, to make sure that our observation in CKR also is true in the context of non-chimeric VEGFR-2,	goal
we mutated Y1057 to F in the full length VEGFR-2, expressed in PAE cells and similarly analyzed for its ability to bind SH2 domain of c-Src.	method
The result showed that VEGFR-2 associates with SH2-Src in VEGF-dependent manner and mutation of Y1057 inhibited association of VEGFR-2 with c-Src (Figure 1K).	result
Altogether, the data show that Y1057 of VEGFR-2 is a major c-Src binding site on VEGFR-2 and its presence is critically required for VEGFR-2 to activate c-Src.	implication

For a total of 25 phosphotyrosines , a single interaction partner was found , and	result
for 13 additional tyrosine residues , we found more than one interacting protein ( Table I )	result
Not surprisingly , 49 out of the 89 investigated	result
tyrosine residues did not have an interaction partner to their phosphorylated form	result
Most of the tyrosine residues without interaction partners are located in and around the kinase domain ,	result
whereas the residues that interacted with specific partners accumulated at the C-terminal regions of the receptors	result
Strikingly , all binding partners with a significant ratio in our assay had either an SH2 or a PTB domain .	result

We next counterstained endogenous LC3	method
to use as a specific marker for autophagosome .	goal
LC3 is a mammalian homologue of Aut7/Apg8 ( Lang et al . 1998 ; Kirisako et al . 1999 ) and is the only mammalian protein	fact
that has been identified to localize to the autophagosome membrane as well as to the cytosol ( Kabeya et al . 2000 ) .	fact
In cells grown in complete medium , LC3 was stained as a cytoplasmic pattern with very fine punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 5 B ) ,	result
as reported previously	result
( Kabeya et al . 2000 ) .	result
Amino acid starvation induced large dots of LC3 staining ,	result
which could represent autophagic vacuoles ( Fig . 5 C ) .	hypothesis
In the starved cells , GFP-Apg5 well colocalized with LC3 structures ( Fig . 5 , C-G ) ,	result
although some GFP-Apg5 spots were very weak for LC3 staining ( Fig . 5F and Fig .	result
On the other hand , there were many spots	result
that were positive for LC3 staining but negative for GFP-Apg5 .	result
The colocalization of Apg5 with part of LC3 suggests	result
that Apg12-Apg5 is targeted to certain restricted structures in the autophagic pathway .	implication

To directly examine the role of Peli1 in IL-1R signaling	goal
, we analyzed the effect of Peli1 deficiency on IL-1beta-stimuated activation of NF-kappaB and IKK .	method
IL-1beta stimulated comparable NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity in Peli1+/+ and Peli1-/- MEFs ( Fig . 5c ) .	result
Consistently , the loss of Peli1 did not affect IL-1beta-stimulated activation of IKK ( Fig . 5d ) .	result
Together , these results suggest	implication
that Peli1 is either functionally redundant with other Peli proteins or not critical in the IL-1R signaling pathway	implication
As IL-1R transduces signals through MyD88 35	fact
, these results are consistent with the dispensable role of Peli1 in IKK-NF-kappaB activation by the MyD88-dependent TLR2 and TLR9 ( Fig . 4c , e ) .	result

Rag and TSC1/2 function independently and in parallel	none
to promote TORC1 signaling	none

We next examined the role of Peli1 in the activation of NF-kappaB in B cells .	method
As seen in MEFs	result
, the Peli1 deficiency markedly inhibited poly ( I : C ) -stimulated activation of NF-kappaB ( Fig . 4c ) and IKK ( Fig . 4d ) .	result
The loss of Peli1 also partially inhibited LPS-stimulated NF-kappaB activation .	result
However , Peli1 was largely dispensable for	result
NF-kappaB activation by CpG and anti-IgM ( Fig . 4c )	result
A similar result was obtained in splenocytes ,	result
in which Peli1 was required for IKK activation by poly ( I : C ) but not by other TLR ligands ( Fig . 4e )	result
Notably , the effect of Peli1 deficiency on LPS-stimulated IKK activation was not appreciable in splenocytes .	result
These results further suggest a role for Peli1 in	implication
mediating IKK-NF-kappaB activation by the TRIF-dependent TLRs , particularly TLR3	implication

To investigate the function of endogenous dRag	goal
, we identified a P element insertion in the 5 ' untranslated region of the dRagC gene .	method
Animals homozygous	result
for this insertion were found to arrest growth at the early third instar larval stage , similar to the growth arrest observed in Tor loss of function mutants36 , and could be restored to viability upon mobilization of the P element ( data not shown )	result
In the larval fat body , clones of cells homozygous for this dRagC mutation showed a statistically significant reduction in cell size under fed but not starved conditions ( Fig . 4c , d ) ,	result
highlighting a requirement for endogenous dRagC in cell growth regulation and nutrient response	implication

Past studies in zebrafish and Xenopus embryos have suggested that overexpression of Wnt5a can trigger intracellular Ca 2+ flux ,	result

It has been proposed that active CamKII protein	hypothesis
can then initiate the mammalian TGF-beta-activated kinase	hypothesis
This phosphorylation of TCF/LEF prevents the beta-catenin-TCF/LEF transcriptional complex from binding to DNA [ 17 , 18 , 36 ] .	result
In this model , inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling due	none

In a variety of organisms and assays , Ca 2+ signaling induced by Wnts has consistently been shown	fact
to be PTX sensitive , as the Fz receptor described as transmitting the inhibitory Wnt signal ( RFz2 )	fact

We next tested	hypothesis
whether increased mRor2 expression was necessary to shift the balance of Wnt5a-mediated activation versus inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in cells overexpressing mFz4	hypothesis
293 and 293Fz4 cells were transiently transfected with the STF reporter and mRor2 and then treated with the indicated Wnt proteins .	method
Figure 6A shows	result
that Wnt5a-induced reporter activation in the presence of mFz4 and LRP5 is abrogated when mRor2 is expressed	result
In addition ,	result
while Wnt5a protein is unable to inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the presence of mFz4 , as compared to parental 293 cells	result
Once again , inhibition of Wnt3a-mediated reporter activation was observed only in the presence of Wnt5a ;	result
mRor2 expression alone did not reduce Wnt3a-mediated reporter activation , indicating that the inhibitory activity is dependent on the presence of Wnt5a	result

Past studies in zebrafish and Xenopus embryos have suggested that overexpression of Wnt5a can trigger intracellular Ca 2+ flux ,	hypothesis

In a variety of organisms and assays , Ca 2+ signaling induced by Wnts has consistently been shown	result
to be PTX sensitive , as the Fz receptor described as transmitting the inhibitory Wnt signal ( RFz2 )	result

We next tested	hypothesis
whether Wnt5a could activate the STF reporter in 293Fz4 cells	hypothesis
Neither Wnt5a protein treatment at high doses nor transfection of Wnt5a DNA into cells expressing mFz4 could activate the STF reporter .	result
shown in Figure 4B , when LRP5 is coexpressed with mFz4	result
Thus , Wnt5a can activate TCF/beta-catenin signaling given the expression of the appropriate receptors .	implication
Interestingly , Wnt5a is unable	result
to activate the STF reporter in 293Fz4 cells transiently transfected with LRP6 , indicating the specificity of the Wnt5a/Fz4/LRP5 signaling complex ( unpublished data )	result

This hyperphosphorylation of p130CAS , paxillin , and FAK is constitutive ,	fact
meaning the cells were not stimulated with growth factors or extracellular ligands	fact
Also , cell spreading was associated with paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Richardson et al. , 1997 ) .	result
Finally , overexpression of PTP1B , a PTP	none
for which p130CAS is a substrate ( Liu et al. , 1996 )	none
These facts led	goal
us to investigate whether the PTP-PEST ( -/- ) cells could be , on the contrary , more prone to attach on fibronectin since p130CAS , paxillin , and FAK are already hyperphosphorylated	goal
Normally growing cells were trypsinized and plated on fibronectin-coated tissue culture plates .	method
After 10 , 15 , and 30 min , random fields were photographed and	method
the cells were counted for the extent of cell spreading	method
The results of two independent experiments with different populations of the two same PTP-PEST ( -/- ) and ( +/- ) clones	method
that were tested in the preceding experiments	method
After 10 min , more PTP-PEST ( -/- ) are opaque ,	result
which is a characteristic of spread cells under phase-contrast microscopy ( Fig . 5 , a and b )	result
Photographs of fields after 30 min ( Fig . 5 , c and d ) as well as a quantitative curve of the spreading time course ( Fig . 5 e ) are also shown .	result

Wnt5a protein was also assayed for its ability	method
to directly stimulate intracellular calcium flux	method
Figure 3C shows	result
that Wnt5a protein treatment at high doses does not alter the intracellular concentration of Ca 2+ in 293 cells , although subsequent ionomycin treatment of the same cells promotes robust Ca 2+ flux	result
Similar results were observed in 293 cells stably expressing mouse Fz4 ( mFz4 ) ;	result
a Wnt receptor thought to be involved in Wnt-stimulated calcium flux ( Figure 3C ) [ 40 ]	implication
In addition , transient treatment with Wnt5a protein does not activate other Ca 2+-sensitive reporter constructs such as an NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter ( unpublished data ) .	result
These data taken together strongly suggest	implication
that Wnt-stimulated Ca 2+ flux is not the direct mechanism utilized by Wnt5a to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling	implication

Rac1 is usually localized primarily in the cytosol as a result of its association to RhoGDI.	fact
However, activated Rac1 translocates to the plasma membrane in an integrin-dependent fashion (del Pozo et al., 2000).	fact
In polarized cells, Rac1 activity has been found in the leading edge, which is in line with its function in actin polymerization, cell protrusion, and motility (Kraynov et al., 2000; Ridley et al., 2003).	fact
Given the fact that beta-Pix binds Rac1 and, thus, may drive local Rac1 activation,	fact
we analyzed beta-Pix localization in polarized cells.	method
For these experiments, we cultured NIH3T3 cells on fibronectin-coated coverslips for 18 h.	method
Cells were fixed and immunostained for endogenous beta-Pix and for paxillin,	method
a marker for FAs.	fact
We found that although paxillin is found in FAs both in the leading edge as well as in the contracting rear of polarized cells, beta-Pix is concentrated in FAs in the leading edge and is virtually absent from the paxillin-positive FAs in the cell body or in the rear of the cell (Fig. 2 G).	result
These data suggest that the differential localization of beta-Pix in polarized cells drives localized activation of Rac1.	implication
